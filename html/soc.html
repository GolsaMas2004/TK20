<h1>Socialism</h1>
<br>
<h2>Socialism is an economic system in which the factors of production are valued in <br>
    relationship to their usefulness to people. Socialists take into account both individual <br>
    needs and greater social needs. They allocate resources using central planning, as <br>
    in a command economy.<br>

    <br>
    Examples of greater social needs include transportation, defense, education, health care, <br>
    and preservation of natural resources. Some also define the common good as caring<br>
    for those who can't directly contribute to production. Examples include the <br>
    elderly, children, and their caretakers. <br>

    <br>
    A mantra of socialism is, "From each according to his ability, to each according to <br>
    his contribution.
    <br>
    
    Everyone in society receives a share of the production based on how much each has <br>
    contributed. This system motivates them to work long hours if they want to receive <br>
    more. Workers receive their share of production after a percentage has been <br>
    deducted for the common good.</h2>
