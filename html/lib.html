<h1>Liberalism</h1>

<br><br>

<h2>‘Liberal’ has meant different things in different situations at different times. Today it<br>
     means a progressive, in fact conservatives have so misused and abused the L-word that <br>
     real liberals (like myself) call ourselves progressives. It better describes the position.<br>
     <br>


    A liberal today basically believes that we should measure the success of our economy <br>
    by the rise in the standard of living of the working man and his family, which is about<br>
    95% of us. -Progress- is defined as a continuously rising standard of living, each <br>
    generation doing a little better than its parents. If the economy grows, if companies do<br>
     well, everyone deserves a share in the wealth created.<br>
     <br>
    
    For more than FORTY YEARS now, the middle class has lost ground. My generation, the <br>
    Post WWII Baby Boomers, were the first generation in US history to not do as well as <br>
    their parents, but each succeeding generation since has done a little worse! We have <br>
    grown slowly poorer and poorer, while the richest 1% has doubled their wealth, and their <br>
    share of ownership, every 10 years or so. This is why we liberals and progressives whine <br>
    so much. I don’t understand why more people don’t seem to be aware of it and realize <br>
    that we can change this with our vote.<br>
    <br>
    
    Liberalism and conservatism also represent two different economic theories. <br>
    Conservatism today (actually neo-conservatism, the Reaganomics philosophy) wants a <br>
    top down economy. The govt. helps corporations and rich investors, and then they <br>
    invest more to make more stuff so there are more and better jobs, so everyone is happy. <br>
    Liberalism believes the govt. should help people directly, and businesses would benefit <br>
    from a healthier market, people growing a little richer every year and buying more <br>
    things. So everyone would be happy. Trickle-down vs trickle-up.<br>
    <br>
    
    The Democratic Party is not really liberal. Presidents Clinton and Obama still cared way  <br>
    too much about the rich, and even during their terms wealth grew more and more  <br>
    concentrated. Clinton moved the Democrats to the right to win in 1992. President  <br>
    Obama bailed out the banks, reimbursing them for the mortgages that had defaulted.  <br>
    But he could have given the money to the mortgage holders themselves, so they could  <br>
    PAY them. The banks would have ended up with the money and people could have  <br>
    saved their homes. Instead millions of Americans lost their homes! The banks did fine, <br>
    though. That’s not what a liberal would have done. <br>

    
    Liberals DON’T want just more and more government for some demented reason. But  <br>
    there are certain things govt. has to do or they won’t get done. Education, national  <br>
    infrastructure, law enforcement, stuff like that. Liberals would like to see affordable  <br>
    health care with universal coverage, and that will only happen with the govt. Getting  <br>
    involved. A single payer plan like almost every other developed country has. That’s  <br>
    another liberal thing these days.</h2>
