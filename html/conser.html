Conservatism
</h1>
<br><br>
 <h2>Conservatism in the simplest terms means carrying on existing traditions <br>rather than changing them. To conserve is to keep and not give up.
    <br>

 <br>There are really two types: the personal kind that resists change because <br>it’s uncomfortable, and the political kind that is represented <br>by an ideology.
<br><br>
                    
 The development of a Conservative ideology took place after <br>the English Commonwealth was overthrown in 1660 when the monarchy was restored.<br> The English Tory party developed a Conservative ideology as it worked to restore the old traditions.<br> <br> 
                   
 In America, there was no Conservative ideology until after <br>World War II. It developed as the philosophical structure of the Republican Party <br>based on Libertarian ideals, traditionalism, and anti-communism. <br>This ideology reached its peak with the election of Ronald Reagan in 1980.<br> <br>
                    
  In the time before there was an operating Conservative ideology in the United States, <br>there was always a Conservative faction resisting opposition efforts to move the country <br>in one direction or the other. The oddest case of this has to be the Civil War which <br>pitted Conservatives against Conservatives.<br>
                    
  The North and President Lincoln sought to conserve (keep) the union,<br> resisting the change that would tear it apart. The South sought to conserve <br>
    their traditional way of life, which included a plantation economy and slavery.</h2>
